Interactive enhancements for the personal portfolio web application

---

## Project Description

This assignment continues from Assignment-1 by adding targeted interactivity and user feedback. The site now includes a live search for projects, collapsible project details, a GitHub Stats card that fetches the public repository count for a provided username/URL, and a Contact section with inline form validation and a clear status message. Hover animations were added to make the UI feel more polished.

The structure remains simple and focused while improving usability and demonstrating practical front-end techniques.

## AI Usage

AI tools supported this assignment by:
- Guiding JavaScript logic for **live search**, **form validation**, and the **GitHub repo count** feature (including loading, error, and retry flows)
- Improving documentation clarity and code organization
- General troubleshooting and small UI/UX suggestions

Tools like Prettier, Live Server, GitHub Copilot, and ChatGPT 5 supported faster iteration and consistency.

## Extensions Used

- **Prettier** – Formatting HTML/CSS/JS
- **Live Server** – Viewing changes instantly in browser
- **HTMLHint** – Detecting HTML issues
- **GitHub Copilot** – Code suggestions
- **ChatGPT 5** – Error fixing support + UX improvements

## Benefits & Challenges

AI helped speed up implementing interactivity, input validation, and error handling patterns.  
A key challenge was keeping solutions simple and aligned with course requirements; I simplified suggestions where necessary and verified each change.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this assignment, I learned how to:
- Build **live search** with DOM updates
- Validate forms and show **inline** error messages + status text
- Fetch API data (GitHub users) with **Loading…**, friendly errors, and a **Retry** action
- Add hover/elevation animations to improve perceived quality
- Apply accessible patterns like labels and `aria-live` regions

## Responsible Adaptation

AI suggestions were reviewed, adapted, and simplified to match my understanding and the course guidelines. Every interactive component was understood and tested manually before submission.
