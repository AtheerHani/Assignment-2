# AI Usage Report

## How I Used AIâ€™s Assistance in this Assignment

1. Helped implement JavaScript logic for:
   - Projects **live search** functionality
   - **Contact form** inline validation and error messages
   - **GitHub repo count** feature (API fetch + loading/retry states)
   - Smooth **hover animations** on cards/sections

2. Assisted with clarifying error handling patterns (loading text, friendly errors, retry flow).

3. Improved text clarity in the README and technical documentation sections.

4. Explained accessibility considerations (labels, aria-live status messages).

5. Suggested a cleaner organization for CSS and JS sections.

## Challenges

Some AI-generated code was more complex than necessary, so I simplified parts to fit my learning level and the assignment requirements.

## Learning Outcomes

- Using AI responsibly as a support tool, not a replacement  
- Understanding the purpose of each added feature  
- Improved confidence in writing JavaScript for real UI features (search, validation, API)
